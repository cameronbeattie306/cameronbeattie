  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
	I am a graduate student in computer science with three summers of research experience in Human–Computer Interaction at the University of Saskatchewan.
My research focuses on low-level keyboard interaction techniques, including keyboard-based pointing methods and chord-driven mode selection systems that reduce reliance on traditional modifier keys, as well as earlier work on glanceable visualizations for rapid information retrieval.
	</br></br>
	Alongside my research, I have a strong foundation in core computer science areas including operating systems, computer networks, image processing and computer vision, and software security.
I am interested in building reliable, well-engineered interactive systems that combine careful empirical evaluation with practical, real-world constraints.
